# TrueSpin
A browser-based slot machine game with skill-based mechanics. Unlike traditional RNG-based slots, TrueSpin uses physics simulation for reel spinning, reels start fast, slow down naturally with deceleration, and stop based on player timing. This adds a "true spin" element where your stop timing can influence outcomes.
